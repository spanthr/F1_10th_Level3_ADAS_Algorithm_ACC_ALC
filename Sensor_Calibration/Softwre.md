Software:


Time data from the two ultrasonic sensors were sampled.
Piece wise calibration was performed for both sensors individually and time data was converted to real distance.
Distance formula was implemented for localization i.e. to find x and y coordinates.
Kalman filter implemented to filter out x and y coordinates. The logic of Kalman filter is shown below:
At last the LED and buzzer were implemented so that they will turn on when the calibration has been completed.
