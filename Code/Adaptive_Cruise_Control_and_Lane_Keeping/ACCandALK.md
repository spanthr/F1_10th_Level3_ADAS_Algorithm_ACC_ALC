## Hardware and assembly

The hardware used for this task are:


Battery power supply for Arduino circuit board.
Bread Board with series and parallel connections
Remote Controlled Traxxas Vehicle
300mAH Lithium ion batteries
USB cable
Jumper cables
Two ultrasonic sensors



## Project 2 Tasks

The objective was to design and implement the vehicle control algorithms such that vehicle was able to maintain a distance of 30cm from any object placed ahead of it. It was also required to stop the vehicle 30cm away from a stationary obstacle placed ahead of it. The second was to maintain a distance of 40cm from the side wall and remain in the center of the defined lane.
